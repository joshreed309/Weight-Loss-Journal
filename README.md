# Weight-Loss-Journal
A full stack application to track weight loss + gym exercises

This full stack application is comprised of a database made through MySQL8.0 + the Sequelize ORM.
I am creating the Back-end API with JavaScript/Node.js and the express library, while using Nodemon to run my server so I am able to constantly have my API running while making changes.

The front-end of this application is built using React, a JavaScript library I have not used before so I will be self-teaching this during the development of this project.
